I have also experienced that the boss is sick, and I am riding a bicycle alone at night to study for myself, so I am afraid that I will die, and I will pick the boss back. If her father is at home, shouldn’t it be easier and a little happier in my heart...

In a family, there are only women with children at home, and the natal family is far away, and the neighbors will say some cool words... Go to the street, guess you are going on a date... Take a courier and 地推others will look at you with that kind of eyes, go to the street and dress well, and come back later. Others just called to complain, nonsense, not tired...
