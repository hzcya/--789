I took my third child to Chongqing alone this year, and the motion sickness was serious. I changed the diaper to the third child, and she pulled the papa. I smelled the smell. I endured the motion sickness, holding the youngest in one hand and holding the other in the other. The bag was vomiting. I took my child’s clothes, diapers, wet tissues, masks, my set of clothes, and the child’s snacks and water. I walked down from my hometown to the township government by car and asked my eldest daughter to walk me to the township. The government told her to walk back. I carried her to the city and took a taxi to the new station, bought the ticket, held the third class bus, got on, got off, and transferred to the bus. I met an uncle on the road, he helped me carry things all the way, and sent me to the station of Chongqing Children's Hospital, before he got off the bus at the next stop... I was numb with my hands alone, and I dragged my exhausted body and carried her on my back. Turning around, looking for a hotel, she was about to lie down and rest, she pulled the papa again, changed it and shouted hungry, took it out to eat, fed, and went back to the hotel at about nine o’clock to take a bath and sleep. The next day I took it. She went to the line, took the number, and queued more than one hundred blood tests. I accompany her hungry and take blood on an empty stomach one morning. I coaxed the crying child, accompanied her on the elevator, down the elevator, and climb the stairs. Going down the stairs, from 8 o’clock to 11 o’clock, it’s our turn. When the blood was drawn, I pressed her hard and carried her to prescribe the medicine. I waited for the inspection report and asked the doctor to give me two bottles of medicine. I opened a few more bottles. I carried the medicine to the hotel and put it away. I took her to eat. When I was done, I went to the hotel and slept until the evening. When the phone was about to run out of power when she was young, she went to eat. After eating, she was in good spirits and didn't want to sleep. She accompanied her to the amusement park and took a bath until 11 o'clock. I took the result that afternoon. That night, I asked the hotel owner to teach me to book a ticket on my mobile phone. I got my sleep, and the next day I took her to take the bus, high-speed rail, and subway. I 地推got off until after nine o’clock in the evening until I met. When I arrived at her father, my heart broke down and I wanted to cry a lot, but I resisted it!
