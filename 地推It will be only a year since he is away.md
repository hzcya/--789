This battery car broke down for half a month. It was 36 degrees in the big summer. I was pushing my third child to the township government. After more than 10 minutes, I cheekyly picked up the pump with an unfamiliar neighbor and walked back to have a baby. , I rode down again with a pump, picked up my second child in the afternoon, took her to the girlfriend’s repair shop and asked her to help me see what the problem was. Later, the fetus did not leak.

It地推 will be only a year since he is away from home. I have faced many big and small problems alone, and I have survived it all by myself!
