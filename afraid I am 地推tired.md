I am most afraid of taking my child to the hospital alone, registering, queuing, crying and crying, let alone taking such a small person away...

I have experienced many times this year by myself. Many times I thought that if he was at home, it would be fine. If I am tired, I am afraid I am 地推tired.

From one year and two months of the little baby, a person carried it on his back and hugged it to two years old, no matter whether it was windy or rainy, or summer, no matter it was the cold wind or what kind of weather, I was always alone. Take the third and pick up the second and the boss!
